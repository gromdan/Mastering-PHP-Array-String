# Mastering PHP Array and String Manipulation

This repository contains PHP code examples and tasks for mastering array and string manipulation in PHP.

## Task 1: String Manipulation

Create a PHP script that demonstrates string manipulation. Start by defining a string variable called `$text` with the value "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Then, write a PHP function that takes `$text` as an argument to perform the following tasks:

1. Convert the string to all lowercase.
2. Replace "brown" with "red" in the string.
3. Print the modified text.

## Task 2: Array Manipulation

In this task, you'll work with arrays. Create a PHP script that performs array manipulation. Begin by creating an array called `$numbers` containing the numbers from 1 to 10. Then, write a PHP function that takes the `$numbers` array as an argument to remove all even numbers from the array and print the resulting array.

## Task 3: Array Sorting

This task focuses on sorting arrays. Create a PHP script that works with an array called `$grades` containing the following values: 85, 92, 78, 88, 95. Write a PHP function that takes `$grades` as an argument to sort the array in descending order and then print the sorted grades as an array.

## Task 4: Multidimensional Array

In this task, you'll work with multidimensional arrays. Create a PHP script that deals with a multidimensional array called `$studentGrades`, which stores the grades of three students. Each student has grades for three subjects: Math, English, and Science. Write a PHP function that takes `$studentGrades` as an argument to calculate and print the average grade for each student.

## Task 5: Password Generator

For this task, create a PHP function called `generatePassword($length)` that generates a random password of the specified length. The password should include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+). Write a PHP program that uses this function to generate a password with a length of 12 characters and then print the generated password.
